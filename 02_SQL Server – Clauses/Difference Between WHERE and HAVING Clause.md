| Purpose  | Filters rows before any grouping or aggregation. | Filters groups after grouping and aggregation.  |
| When Applied  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Used With  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Aggregate Functions  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Scope  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
