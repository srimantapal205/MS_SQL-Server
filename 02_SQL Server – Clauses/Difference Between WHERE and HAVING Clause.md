#### The WHERE clause and the HAVING clause in SQL serve different purposes, though both are used for filtering data. Here is a detailed comparison of the two:


### Difference Between WHERE and HAVING Clause
|Aspect  | WHERE Clause | HAVING Clause |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Purpose  | Filters rows before any grouping or aggregation. | Filters groups after grouping and aggregation.  |
| When Applied  | Applied before GROUP BY is executed.  | Applied after GROUP BY is executed.  |
| Used With  | Used with non-aggregated columns or conditions.  | Used with aggregated columns or conditions.  |
| Aggregate Functions  | Cannot be used with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, etc.  | Can be used with aggregate functions.  |
| Scope  | Filters individual rows.  | Filters aggregated data (groups).  |

### Key Points
    The WHERE clause works on raw data and evaluates conditions row by row.
    The HAVING clause works on aggregated data that results from the GROUP BY clause.

### Using WHERE Clause
    Find the sales records where the region is "North."

    SELECT Salesperson, Region, Total_Sales
    FROM Sales
    WHERE Region = 'North';

### Using HAVING Clause
    Find regions where the total sales exceed $50,000.

    SELECT Region, SUM(Total_Sales) AS Total_Sales
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY Region
    HAVING SUM(Total_Sales) > 50000;
